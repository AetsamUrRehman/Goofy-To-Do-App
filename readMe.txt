Instructions for the use of the program

Would recommend reloading the page before testing anything
Tried to cover everything in this document

Features

1. Celebration Animations
When completing a task a celebration will play on the screen,
selecting from the celebrations that are turned on in the settings.

2. Delete Animation and Sounds
When deleting a task a delete animation plays that along with a sound,
they can also be toggled in the settings. Volume can also be adjusted
in the settings.

3. Background Switcher
Paint bucket button allows you to change the background

4. Black Cat 
Sits in the corner doing idle animation, when clicked runs across the bottom
and bounces of screen edge or if the To-Do panel extends too low then it bounces
off the wall of the panel.

5. Fruit Ninja
Fruits fly up in arc motion every 20-25s like in the game Fruit Ninja and
splat when coming in contact with the cursor.

6. Cookie Clicker
Like the cookie clicker flash game, spawns every 60s

7. Rain Cloud
Follows the mouse and rains, spawns every 40-45s

8.Konami Code
Unlocks secret stuff in top right corner

9. Rainbow Mode
Looks cool

10. Minigame
Whack a mole game, pretty simple

11. Mbappe
Cringe Mbappe

12. Random Events Menu
User can toggle the random events manually (Fruit Ninja, Rain Cloud, Cookie Clicker)
Try spamming the Fruit Ninja button

13.BSOD Prank
On every new load of the page, whenever the first task is added,
plays BSOD image with sound in fullscreen as a prank

14. To-Do Panel
Basic task create, delete and toggle complete,
Using spaces between words is ok and whole paragraphs can be written,
Writing an extremely long word without space pushes letters out of panel
and extends page rightwards so user can have completely empty space and enjoy the rainbow background,
Not a bug it's a feature ;)
